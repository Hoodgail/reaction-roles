**Reaction Roles Bot**  
This is a discord bot made by the School Simplified Technical Team, to fix our reaction roles problem. Our old reaction roles bot didn't register reactions half the time, and was overall very unstable. This bot should run smoothly, as long as the reaction role channel isn't deleted, the bot's perms aren't removed, or any role that is related to a reaction role isn't deleted.

**Commands**  
rr!create <channel id> <role id> <emoji id>  
rr!delete <object id>   
rr!edit <object id> <new channel id> <new role id> <new emoji id>  
rr!help / rr!help <command>   

Channel ID: The ID of the channel you want the reaction role in.  
Role ID: The ID of the role you want the reaction role to give.  
Emoji ID: The ID of the emoji you want the user to react with.  
Object ID: A code that is obtained after making a reaction role. This ID is associated with a reaction role, until it's deleted. This is the one thing that can not be edited out.
